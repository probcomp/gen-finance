;; - `:trials`: total number of simulations to generate
;; - `:periods`: number of time periods to simulate the business
;; - `:value-target`: the goal business value, used for importance sampling.
;; - `:n-samples`: number of samples used in importance sampling
;; - `:free->pay`: percentage of users that convert from free => paid each time period
;; - `:ad-spend-increase`: percentage increase in ad spending per period
;; - `:viral-growth-kicker`: ratio of new viral users to last time period's total new users
;; - `:retention-mean`: average user retention rate, constant per simulation
